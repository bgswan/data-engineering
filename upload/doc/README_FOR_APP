The solution has been built using Ruby and Rails with the following versions:

	ruby: 1.9.2
	rails: 3.2.1
	
A .rvmrc file is included to switch to Ruby version 1.9.2
	
Tests are provided written using rSpec

Installation
------------

From the upload directory run

	bundle install
	rails server
	
The application can be accessed at 

	http://localhost:3000
	
Functionality
-------------

From the index page of the application, select a file to be uploaded and click 'import'. 
The application will upload the file to the database and report the number of records uploaded and the total revenue from the records uploaded.
The file should be in the format defined in the initial instructions.
If no file is supplied, nothing is uploaded. If a file with an incorrect format is uploaded the import will fail and nothing will be uploaded, an error message will be reported.
